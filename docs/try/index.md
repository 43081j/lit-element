Build your first web component and use it in a web page.

Try lit-element in live code samples without installing anything:

*  [Create your first custom element](create).
*  [Use your custom element in a web page](use).
*  [Add a property value to your element template](properties).
*  [Add a loop and an “if” statement to your template](expressions).
*  [Add an event handler to your template](events).
*  [Style your element template](style).

If you're ready to dive in, [Set up lit-element locally](/tools/setup) to get started with your own development environment.
